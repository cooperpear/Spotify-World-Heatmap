# Project Spotify

This project uses a modified version of cheerio to scrape data from Spotify, and uses mapbox visualization to render the worldwide data set of current listener user habits.

## Getting Started

Refer to the (Installing) section if you would like to scrape your own data and store in an SQL database. 

## Installing

Run your SQL database program, connect to your server. <br>
Run server.js. <br>
